    "description": "Freak Show is the first foray into interactive software from the underground San Francisco band The Residents. It's a bit adventure, yet without a linear plot and puzzles. It's best described as a multimedia experience, a digital art showcase, or a virtual visit to, well, a freak show. Characters to meet include Tex the Barker, Herman the Human Mole, Harry the Head, Wanda the Worm Woman, Jelly Jack, Benny the Bump. The game featured some of the best 3D renderings for a computer program, at the time, and everything was rendered and animated by world-famous computer animator Jim Ludtke.",
