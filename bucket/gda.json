    "description": "GDA, a new Dalvik bytecode decompiler, is implemented in C++, which has the advantages of faster analysis and lower memory&disk consumption and an stronger ability to decompiling the APK, DEX, ODEX, OAT files(supports JAR, CLASS and AAR files since 3.79). GDA is completely self-independent and works without Java VM and installation, so it works well in any newly installed windows system and virtual machine system without additional configuration.",
